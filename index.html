William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English<br>
 language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations,<br>
  consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated<br>
   into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.<br><br>

Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna<br>
 and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company<br>
  called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three<br>
   years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical<br>
    appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often criticised for<br>
     failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period.<br><br>

Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best<br>
 work produced in these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the<br>
  finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.<br><br>

Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's,<br>
 John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all<br>
  but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but
  <br> for all time".<br><br>

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance.<br>
 His plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world.<br>
